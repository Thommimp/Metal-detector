# Metal-detector

Arduino code for metal detector project.

## Overview

**Note:** This repository contains only the Arduino code for a DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) metal detector as part of a larger hardware project. It does not include hardware schematics, enclosure design, or other componentsâ€”just the code that runs on the microcontroller.

The code demonstrates how to use an Arduino to detect metal objects based on changes in signal frequency and amplitude, using DFT-based signal processing.

## Features

- **DFT Metal Detection:** Implements a metal detector algorithm using Discrete Fourier Transform principles.
- **Arduino Compatibility:** Designed to run on standard Arduino boards.
- **Signal Processing:** Analyzes coil signals to identify metallic objects.
- **Simple Hardware Interface:** Uses basic components like coils, resistors, and capacitors.

## How It Works

The metal detector works by sending a signal through a coil and measuring the response. When a metallic object is near the coil, it changes the signal's frequency and amplitude. The Arduino samples these signals and processes them using a DFT algorithm to detect these changes, providing a simple indication (e.g., LED or buzzer) when metal is detected.
